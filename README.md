# Refactoring

这个项目的灵感来自与我大学生活的期末复习阶段复习课程所遇到的困难，通常一本书的内容和对应ppt的页数是非常多的，
如果在日常的学习生活中不能做到不断的积累，那么在最后的复习阶段是非常痛苦的。如今，人工智能的发展已经开始影响
各行各业，所以我想能不能打造一个以人工智能为驱动的学习软件来辅助学习与思考，我们可以定下阶段目标，由人工智能来
帮我们分析目标，拆分成每日/每周任务，来帮助我们进行学习计划的决策。在复习的时候我们也可以通过导入教材或者ppt由人工智能
来帮助我们提取出来复习重点。我希望在不断的打磨后，它可以帮助我们解决大部分与学习内容无直接相关的决策，让我们可以
将全部精力专注于学习与思考。

作者目前也只是一名普通大二学生，技术水平有限还不足以支持整个项目的开发，所以先写下创建了这个空仓库，希望在不久的将来
通过不断地学习最终可以实现这个软件。


The inspiration for this project comes from the challenges I faced during my final exam preparation in college. Typically, the content in textbooks and corresponding PowerPoint slides is extensive. If one fails to consistently accumulate knowledge throughout daily study, the final review phase can become particularly overwhelming. Today, with artificial intelligence advancing and influencing various industries, I began to wonder if it would be possible to create an AI-driven learning software to assist with studying and critical thinking. We could set phased goals and have the AI analyze them, breaking them down into daily or weekly tasks to help us make informed decisions about our study plans. During review sessions, we could also import textbooks or PowerPoint materials for the AI to extract key review points. I hope that, through continuous refinement, this tool can help us resolve most decisions unrelated to the learning content itself, allowing us to fully focus our energy on learning and critical thinking.

As the author, I am currently just an ordinary sophomore with limited technical skills, which are insufficient to support the full development of this project. Therefore, I have created this empty repository for now, hoping that through persistent learning, I can eventually realize this software in the near future.
